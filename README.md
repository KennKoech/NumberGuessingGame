# NumberGuessingGame
Number Guessing Game
I developed this game on Android Studio using Kotlin.
The program picks a random number between 0 and 1000. 
The user then has an unlimited number of guesses to try and find the number picked by the program.
When the user gets it right, the game displays a winner message and the number of tries it took the user.
